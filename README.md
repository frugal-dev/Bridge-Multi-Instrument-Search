**Bridge** is a desktop application that allows you to search for and download charts that can be played in  games like Clone Hero, YARG, etc...

This is the desktop version of [Chorus Encore](https://www.enchor.us/).

This specific fork is made for my own uses that allows multiple instrument search. For example, pro drums + guitar specifically. This branch was created with version v3.4.0 from the source.
